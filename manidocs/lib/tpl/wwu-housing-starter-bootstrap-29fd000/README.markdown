======

[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) template

This template is designed to be responsive on all modern devices, accessable, and good looking.
It aims to replace most of the default Dokuwiki styling with equivalents from available Bootstrap styles.
